I'm a Ph.D. in Engineering with a focus on Industrial Engineering from Universidad del Valle, where I also earned my degrees in Statistics and Applied Economics. Currently, I’m an assistant professor at Universidad del Valle, where I lead courses in statistics, econometrics, business analytics, machine learning for finance, data visualization, and quantitative finance.

Throughout my academic journey, I’ve collaborated with several leading universities in Colombia, including Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali, Universidad ICESI, Universidad San Buenaventura Cali, and Universidad del Tolima—sharing knowledge and training students in areas at the intersection of data and finance.

My research explores the dynamics of energy markets and energy finance, as well as quantitative approaches in business analytics, risk management, and econometrics. I’ve published in specialized journals on energy and finance, contributing to the development of data-driven insights that inform policy and business decisions in complex, evolving environments.
