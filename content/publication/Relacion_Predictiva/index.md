abstract: Various analyses have studied the hypothesis of the change in mortality rates, finding, in some cases, a decrease, which has been associated to different factors, including economic growth. This study applies a cross-quantilogram to study the relationship between GDP per capita and the mortality rate for both men and women, taking the United Kingdom as a case study. The objective is to show that there are associations between different quantiles of the variables studied. It is found that there are asymmetric associations, the results show that there is a greater impact of GDP (Gross domestic product) per capita on the mortality rate, compared to the opposite relationship. In the case of women and men, high quantiles of economic growth have a greater impact on reducing mortality rates compared to low quantiles of economic growth, this may be a factor that can be attributed to the highly loaded labor force for males.
