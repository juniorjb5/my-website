I feel very fortunate to have been to IFABS 2021, and much more, that it was the first conference I attend in the development of my PhD. An experience that helps me grow a lot personally and academically. And it's a great starting point for new goals.

Special thanks to my thesis supervisors: Diego F. Manotas and Jorge M. Uribe, as well as to the School of Industrial Engineering of the Universidad del Valle.
