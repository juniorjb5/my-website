The next Wednesday (16/Feb/2022) I'll present the conference ["Commonality, macroeconomic factors and bank profitability"](https://www.ub.edu/irea/working_papers/2021/202113.pdf) in the Seminario CIEF of the University EAFIT of MedellÃ­n - Colombia.

This research was selected for presentation at the IFABS 2021 - Oxford conference [(see more..)](https://www.joaquibarandica.com/project/ifabs/).

Thanks to the School of Economics and Finance for the invitation. Next, the information for the connection to the conference.
