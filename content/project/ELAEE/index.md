I will be at the 8Â° ELAEE 2022 â€“ Energy Transition in Latinamerica that will take place at the Universidad de BogotÃ¡ Jorge Tadeo Lozano, next November 20 and 22, 2022.

I will present the research "Decision tools from index fund finance to explore the path towards a scenario of renewable energy generation with globalization and high specialization of regional electricity markets".
