Traditionally, having a credit card was a sign of having high economic power, but this has now changed. Now we have at our disposal a wide variety of types of credit cards. This is because not only banks can offer them, but some businesses have also started offering credit cards to adapt to the needs of consumers.\nCredit cards have multiple functions and not everyone who has one implements it for the same purpose, so we want to know the behavior of use of approximately 9,000 active credit card holders, which have 17 variables of behavior, we carry out a segmentation of groups among the individuals to be studied, in relation to their behaviors; thus allowing us to simplify the complexity of the sample space with many dimensions while preserving its information.\nIn our database we take into account the following data\u0026hellip;\ngraph TD\rA[Variables]\rA --\u0026gt; B(Saldo) --\u0026gt; |Translation| D(BALANCE)\rA --\u0026gt; E(Frec_Saldo) --\u0026gt; |Translation| F(BALANCE_FREQUENCY)\rA --\u0026gt; G(Compras) --\u0026gt; |Translation| H(PURCHASES)\rA --\u0026gt; I(Compras_UnaVez) --\u0026gt; |Translation| J(ONEOFF_PURCHASES)\rA --\u0026gt; K(Compras_aPlazos) --\u0026gt; |Translation| L(INSTALLMENTS_PURCHASES)\rA --\u0026gt; M(Efectivo_Adelantado) --\u0026gt; |Translation| N(CASH_ADVANCE)\r graph TD\rA[Variables]\rA --\u0026gt; N(Frec_Compras) --\u0026gt; |Translation| O(PURCHASES_FREQUENCY)\rA --\u0026gt; P(Fre_Compras_UnaVez) --\u0026gt; |Translation| Q(ONEOFF_PURCHASES_FREQUENCY)\rA --\u0026gt; R(frec_Compras_aPlazos) --\u0026gt; |Translation| S(PURCHASES_INSTALLMENTS_FREQUENCY)\rA --\u0026gt; T(Frec_Efectivo_Adelantado) --\u0026gt; |Translation| U(CASH_ADVANCE_FREQUENCY)\rA --\u0026gt; V(Num_trans_Efectivo_Adelantado) --\u0026gt; |Translation| W(CASH_ADVANCE_TRX)\rA --\u0026gt; X(Num_trans_Compras) --\u0026gt; |Translation| Y(PURCHASES_TRX)\r graph TD\rA[Variables]\rA --\u0026gt; B(Limite_Credito) --\u0026gt; |Translation| C(CREDIT_LIMIT)\rA --\u0026gt; D(Pagos_Realizados) --\u0026gt; |Translation| E(PAYMENTS)\rA --\u0026gt; F(Num_Min_Pagos_Realizados) --\u0026gt; |Translation| G(MINIMUM_PAYMENTS)\rA --\u0026gt; H(Porcent_PagosCompletos_Realizados) --\u0026gt; |Translation| I(PRC_FULL_PAYMENT)\rA --\u0026gt; J(Tenencia_Servicio) --\u0026gt; |Translation| K(TENURE)\r Unsupervised analysis bases its training process on a data set that does not have a previously established label. Multivariate methodologies are relevant to finding answers about data.\nThe Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique, applied by Karl Pearson, who was responsible for the application of statistics, as the PCA method in 1901; is used for quantitative variables, allowing to simplify the dimension of the data creating new variables to characterize each individual, these variables are called main components, which are given by the following linear combination\n$$Z = \\lambda_1 X_1 + \\lambda_2 X_2 + . . . + \\lambda_p X_p$$\nTo see the classification of the model data set, Ward\u0026rsquo;s method is used, presented by Joe H. Ward, which considers all the clusters and the algorithm calculates the sum of the squared distances within each one, to later merge them and manage to minimize them.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s go to R We point out that the code and results are in spanish.

For this reason, the eigen values of the first 5 components were found, which are reflected in the following table\n   PC 1 PC 2 PC 3 PC 4 PC 5     2.151580834 1.861083634 1.231306920 1.134686503 1.032969064    The Kaiser criterion recommends that 5 components should be selected. However, the value of the eigenvalues between components 3, 4 and 5 do not vary much compared to the first 2 components. Given this observation, it was decided to plot a bar chart with the percentage of variance or explanation provided by each component, in order to have a broader and more detailed view of the choice of components\nThe graph shows an interesting behavior, components 3, 4 and 5 do meet the Kaiser criterion as mentioned above, but between these the percentage of explained information does not have much difference, so it can be said that there is noise between them. . For this reason, it was decided to use 3 components, that is, we have a variance percentage of approximately 56.5% for our analysis.\ngraph TD\rA[PC 1] --\u0026gt; B(Purchases made)\rA[PC 1] --\u0026gt; C(Purchase transactions made)\rA[PC 1] --\u0026gt; D(One-time purchases)\rA[PC 1] --\u0026gt; E(Purchases made in installments)\rA[PC 1] --\u0026gt; F(Purchase Frequency)\rB --\u0026gt; G{Interpretation}\rC --\u0026gt; G{Interpretation}\rD --\u0026gt; G{Interpretation}\rE --\u0026gt; G{Interpretation}\rF --\u0026gt; G{Interpretation}\rG --\u0026gt; H[Purchasing power]\r  Based on the variables that most influence the explanation of the first component, this factor was named purchasing power; since its definition that groups and relates the variables. \u0026ldquo;Purchasing power, purchasing power or purchasing power is the amount of goods or services that can be obtained with a fixed amount of money depending on the price level\u0026rdquo;\n graph TD\rA[PC 2] --\u0026gt; B(Cash advanced by the user)\rA[PC 2] --\u0026gt; C(Frequency of cash advanced by the user)\rA[PC 2] --\u0026gt; D(Transactions made with cash in advance)\rA[PC 2] --\u0026gt; E(Balance for purchases)\rA[PC 2] --\u0026gt; F(Credit limit)\rB --\u0026gt; G{Interpretation}\rC --\u0026gt; G{Interpretation}\rD --\u0026gt; G{Interpretation}\rE --\u0026gt; G{Interpretation}\rF --\u0026gt; G{Interpretation}\rG --\u0026gt; H[Payment capacity]\r  Regarding the second component, it was called payment capacity, since in agreement with the Bank of Mexico (Banxico), there are users who have fixed monthly income and when making purchases they make their payments in cash or at the end of the month to avoid interest and build a good credit history, plus maintain access to the rewards and benefits on offer.\n graph TD\rA[PC 3] --\u0026gt; B(Balance Update Frequency)\rA[PC 3] --\u0026gt; C(Frequency of installment purchases)\rA[PC 3] --\u0026gt; D(Purchases made in a single payment)\rA[PC 3] --\u0026gt; E(Amount of payments made)\rA[PC 3] --\u0026gt; F(Credit limit)\rB --\u0026gt; G{Interpretation}\rC --\u0026gt; G{Interpretation}\rD --\u0026gt; G{Interpretation}\rE --\u0026gt; G{Interpretation}\rF --\u0026gt; G{Interpretation}\rG --\u0026gt; H[Excessive consumption]\r  Finally, the third component was called excessive consumption, according to Marco Carrera, director of Market Studies of the National Commission for the Defense of Users of Financial Services (Condusef) in 2009, people who frequently buy from purchases that satisfy their basic needs are considered people who fall into the trend of consumerism, for which they see the need to pay the minimum cost of credit cards and thus maintain their credit limit and all the benefits that this entails.\n PCA - GRAPHS [Click to see the code] fviz_pca_ind(res.pca,\rcol.ind = \u0026quot;cos2\u0026quot;, # Color by the quality of representation\rgradient.cols = c(\u0026quot;#00AFBB\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;#E7B800\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;#FC4E07\u0026quot;),\rrepel = FALSE # Avoid text overlapping\r)\rfviz_pca_var(res.pca,\rcol.var = \u0026quot;contrib\u0026quot;, # Color by contributions to the PC\rgradient.cols = c(\u0026quot;#00AFBB\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;#E7B800\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;#FC4E07\u0026quot;),\rrepel = FALSE # Avoid text overlapping\r)\rfviz_pca_biplot(res.pca, repel = FALSE,\rcol.var = \u0026quot;#2E9FDF\u0026quot;, # Variables color\rcol.ind = \u0026quot;#696969\u0026quot; # Individuals color\r)\reig.val \u0026lt;- get_eigenvalue(res.pca)\reig.val #Valores propios de los componentes compuestos\rres.var \u0026lt;- get_pca_var(res.pca)\rres.var$coord # Coordinates\rres.var$contrib # Contribuccion de las variables a los ejes\rres.var$cos2 # Quality of representation\rView(res.var$contrib[,1:3]) # Miro los 3 primeros factores\r# Resultados por individuos\rres.ind \u0026lt;- get_pca_ind(res.pca)\rres.ind$coord # Coordinates\rres.ind$contrib # Contribuccion a los componentes\rres.ind$cos2 # Quality of representation View(res.ind$contrib[,1:3]) # Miro los tres primeros factores\r  CLUSTERING [Click to see the code] resultado_ACP\u0026lt;-FactoClass(Datos,dudi.pca)\r3 3 4 resultado_ACP$cluster NuevaBase\u0026lt;-data.frame(Cluster=resultado_ACP$cluster,Datos) # unir la nueva base de datos con la nueva variable cluster\rView(NuevaBase)\rplot(resultado_ACP$dudi) # Grafico del an?lisis\rs.corcircle((resultado_ACP$dudi)$co)\rs.label((resultado_ACP$dudi)$li,label=row.names(Datos)) #Graf.

These people prefer not to pay for their purchases with a credit card, they prefer to withdraw cash in advance to make said purchases. Your credit limit is very high, since your income is high and the time with which you pay your cash advances is very low. In short, they are rich people who do not buy with their card, perhaps so that there is no record of their purchases. In terms of social level, they are high-income people who prefer to avoid registering their bank transactions. This class of clients was classified as passive clients.\n graph LR\rA[Class 1 \u0026lt;br /\u0026gt; PASSIVE CLIENTS \u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;] --\u0026gt; B(Purchasing power)\rA --\u0026gt; C(Payment capacity)\rA --\u0026gt; D(Excessive consumption)\rB --- E(Low)\rC --- F(High)\rD --- G(Low)\r  The second class is made up of very low balance clients, actually the second lowest among the classes. They are the class with the lowest rate of purchases, whether in instant purchases or installment purchases. The aforementioned is reflected in your credit limit, since you earn little money, do not enter installments and have a low rate of payments through your cards, your credit limit is relatively low. Socially, they are low-income people who do not have the possibility of accessing constant purchases, they prefer to save their money and not take risks. These clients were called inactive clients.\n graph LR\rA[Class 2 \u0026lt;br /\u0026gt; INACTIVE CLIENTS \u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;] --\u0026gt; B(Purchasing power)\rA --\u0026gt; C(Payment capacity)\rA --\u0026gt; D(Excessive consumption)\rB --- E(Low)\rC --- F(Low)\rD --- G(Low)\r  The third class is made up of clients with the lowest balance on the card but who make cash purchases, that is, they do not earn much money and their salary on the card is low, however, they continue to consume, make purchases frequently, whether for goods or services, by means of a credit card, generally in installments or installments because it is not possible for them to pay instantly due to the little money they have in their accounts. In addition, the payment limit is lower than the global average for all clients, due to their low income level. It is not the lowest credit limit among the classes because, by frequently making installment purchases, their credit history is good, however, the time in which they pay their debts is not favorable for their credit limit. They are low-income people who are passionate about indulging their frequent desires, even if that means paying installments. They were called active clients.\n graph LR\rA[Class 3 \u0026lt;br /\u0026gt; ACTIVE CLIENTS \u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;] --\u0026gt; B(Purchasing power)\rA --\u0026gt; C(Payment capacity)\rA --\u0026gt; D(Excessive consumption)\rB --- E(High)\rC --- F(Low)\rD --- G(Low)\r  In the fourth class are present clients who use credit cards more, since they maintain a high rate of frequent purchases instantly or in installments, because they handle a large amount of money and keep a balance to later acquire any good or service. , which is why they have a high profile in the banking institution and benefit from obtaining a higher credit limit, in addition to withdrawing very little cash in advance. Socially, they were called high-income people who spend their money to satisfy their tastes, apart from their basic needs. These people are potential clients.\n graph LR\rA[Class 4 \u0026lt;br /\u0026gt; POTENCIAL CLIENTS \u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;] --\u0026gt; B(Purchasing power)\rA --\u0026gt; C(Payment capacity)\rA --\u0026gt; D(Excessive consumption)\rB --- E(High)\rC --- F(High)\rD --- G(High)\r Market strategies   Passive clients, they have very low purchases, due to the lack of information on promotions and discounts, for which, from the user\u0026rsquo;s database, a telephone number can be contacted and begin to make informative use of that means of communication. Likewise, the advisors can be in contact by means of telephone calls, in order to spread the information and make sure that the user obtains the benefits. To motivate you, you can initially generate promotions, accumulation of points that can later be redeemed in some good or cash refunds.\n  Inactive clients, an incentive plan can be implemented, where an order of quotas is proposed, which allow them to go to certain places to access a product as a reward for the high use of credit cards, this strategy can be carried out carried out in the people who buy the most and with that constant use is promoted.\n  Active clients, by maintaining constant purchases, the accumulation of points can be implemented, either to obtain a free product or with good discounts and the exclusivity of participating in raffles of some good, such as appliances. Likewise, up to 3 installments without interest can be managed, with the aim that the client is motivated and makes their purchases.\n  To encourage the best credit card clients, rewards or incentives can be generated for the number of purchases made, whether monthly or semi-annually, likewise, miles can be accumulated so that users can obtain tickets without high costs on planes and in the VIP area, as well as tickets to concerts, entertainment areas, restaurants, among others.\n  New clients PREDICT [Click to see the code] ind.test \u0026lt;- Datos[8632:8636, 1:17] #5 clientes para realizar la prediccion\rhead(ind.test)\rind.test.coord \u0026lt;- predict(res.pca, newdata = ind.test)\rind.test.coord[, 1:3] # Miro los primeros dos componentes\r# Utilizo el gr√°fico anterior y le anexo los nuevos individuos\rp \u0026lt;- fviz_pca_ind(res.pca, repel = TRUE)\rfviz_add(p, ind.test.coord, color =\u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;)\rnuevospuntos\u0026lt;-data.frame(ind.test.coord)\rNP2\u0026lt;-data.frame(names = rownames(nuevospuntos), nuevospuntos)\rNewgrafico\u0026lt;-data.frame((resultado_ACP$dudi)$li , Grupo)\rX11()\r#PC1 ; PC2\rggplot(Newgrafico, aes(x = Axis1, y = Axis2, color = Grupo)) +\rgeom_point() +\rgeom_point(NP2, mapping=aes(x=PC1,y=PC2, color = \u0026quot;Nuevos\u0026quot;, label = names), size=5.5)+ theme_bw()\r  We managed to classify customers into classes depending on their characteristics in the use of the credit card. However, the banking institution will not always have the same number of clients and these will not always present the same behavior, therefore, it is necessary that the created model has the ability to predict to which group a client with new characteristics should belong management regarding the use of your credit card.\nThat said, a classification test was carried out with 5 clients without a group, to evaluate the effectiveness of the model at the time of cataloging. This test is done graphically, incorporating new clients represented by purple dots in the plans previously designed in graph 4; It is worth mentioning that the value of the characteristic variables of the five clients with respect to the use of their credit card is known.\nThe visualization of the new clients in the groups is better illustrated in the plane composed of components 1 and 2, for this reason the main analysis was carried out with this plane. Now, among these 5 clients, the model classified 3 of them as members of group 2 (inactive clients), and the rest as members of group 3 (active clients).\nSupervised learning We realize a supervised analyses using the classification founded in the clustering. We use 75% of the data as training, and 25% as test.\nThe class that better is classified is 4.

On this occasion, we had the opportunity to participate in the advances in statistical workshop developed by the Colombian Statistics Society (SCE - Sociedad Colombiana de Estad√≠stica), Inter American Statistical Institute, and UNAL - Universidad Nacional de Colombia.\n  Download the slides.\nAbstract This paper proposes to study the external macroeconomic determinants on financial markets. Under the hypothesis of efficient markets, prices reflect all available information, so this paper will focus on the MSCI Colombia index, which measures the high and mid-capitalization segments of the stock market. The literature focuses on studying the macroeconomic effects at the variable level on the income market. However, from the statistical and econometric point of view, the possible omission of different effects associated with macroeconomic variables that are not considered in the different models in the literature is proposed, this shows a possible increase in the error of the estimates, which can generate biased estimates of macroeconomic movements on returns in the stock market. This is why a detailed analysis of the impact of the global set of macroeconomic variables on market capitalization is necessary.\nIn this work, the generation of latent macroeconomic factors is proposed from a large set of variables, subsequently the macroeconomic factors are identified and interpreted to determine the effects in the terms of trade on the MSCI Colombia index. An extensive database is used, made up of 106 macroeconomic variables corresponding to the period 2001-2020, and the effect of macroeconomic shocks is estimated using a DLNM model.\nOur results show there are mainly three statistical factors that underlie the macroeconomic dynamics in Colombia. The results suggest that the first latent factor is associated with economic activity. The second factor is related to the external sector (imports, exports and exchange rate), and the third factor to the labor force and retail. We conclude that the effects are asymmetric on the rental market in addition to achieving stabilization of the shock after the third period. In addition, we identify that the market is more sensitive to economic activity compared to other macroeconomic factors.\nüëã All Comments are welcome.\nüì© orlando.joaqui@correounivalle.edu.co\nüì© osorio.brayan@correounivalle.edu.co\nüì© carolina.ramirez.patino@correounivalle.edu.co\n","date":1637798400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1637798400,"objectID":"23d723f3a836e87261acad15e471039f","permalink":"www.joaquibarandica.io/project/sce/","publishdate":"2021-11-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.joaquibarandica.io/project/sce/","section":"project","summary":"Nov. 25 - 26 / 2021","tags":["Colombian Stock Exchange","Finance","DLNM","Macroeconomics"],"title":"Workshop Advances in Statistical Methods","type":"project"},{"authors":["Orlando Joaqui Barandica"],"categories":["R","Xaringan","ggplot2","plotly","highcharter","dplyr"],"content":"\r\rThese slides will cover a mix of styles for #DataViz.

On this occasion, we had the opportunity to participate in the advances in statistical workshop developed by the Colombian Statistics Society (SCE - Sociedad Colombiana de Estad√≠stica), and Universidad del Valle.\n  Download the slides.\nAbstract This paper proposes to observe the effect of the price of natural gas and the behavior of climatic factors on the price of electricity in times of crisis. At present it is known that Germany has increased the price of electricity due to complications for its production, which is produced by means of renewable and non-renewable energies.\nThe first option being the most optimal since the cost is lower, however, they are not constant in the production flow due to the constant climatic changes, for which the electricity generated by non-renewable energies continues to have a large participation in Germany\u0026rsquo;s electricity matrix.\nFor this reason, natural gas continues to be the fundamental pillar for the production of electricity, but it has been affected in recent years, due to the reduction in imports of natural gas of which Russia is its largest supplier, generated by the political discussions with Ukraine, through which various sanctions have been presented, of which the export of natural gas has been one of them. For this reason, it is proposed to observe the impact of the price of natural gas on the price of electricity in Germany during a period of time from 2015 to 2022.\nThe use of GAS models is presented to observe the behavior of prices, the which allows a better adjustment of the data by having the versatility of working with distributions other than the normal distribution.\nOur results show: the price of natural gas presents a direct positive correlation with the price of electricity since if there is a shortage of natural gas as it occurred thanks to Russia\u0026rsquo;s problems with its exports, natural gas tends to increase its price and in turn the price of electricity respectively. In addition, climatic variables are important because they help to counteract the effect that the increase in the price of gas is producing.\nüëã All Comments are welcome.\nüì© orlando.joaqui@correounivalle.edu.co\nüì© cesar.ojeda@correounivalle.edu.co\nüì© gina.ramirez@correounivalle.edu.co\nüì© wilber.hernandez@correounivalle.edu.co\n","date":1613347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613347200,"objectID":"b5bf62855414d70033e8cfbc5c963ae4","permalink":"www.joaquibarandica.io/project/sce2/","publishdate":"2021-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.joaquibarandica.io/project/sce2/","section":"project","summary":"Feb. 16 - 17 / 2023","tags":["Energy","Electricity Prices","Climate","Renewable Energy","GAS model"],"title":"Workshop Advances in Statistical Methods","type":"project"},{"authors":["Orlando Joaqui Barandica"],"categories":["Transport","Multinomial regression","Economy"],"content":"Visit  üëâ Full Publication  ","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575158400,"objectID":"5bdeef61dfd0d5a68b77618fed7e2a4b","permalink":"www.joaquibarandica.io/publication/libreempresa/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.joaquibarandica.io/publication/libreempresa/","section":"publication","summary":"2019 - *(with Rodriguez-Barco, D.).* '**Libre Empresa, 16 (2), 65-79**'","tags":["Multinomial regression","Logit","Probit","Transport"],"title":"Choosing the type of transport in the working class in Colombia: An analysis by region","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Orlando Joaqui Barandica"],"categories":null,"content":"Visit  üëâ Full Publication  ","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575158400,"objectID":"345b54030a26ea6162a297a04476f8db","permalink":"www.joaquibarandica.io/publication/tramas/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.joaquibarandica.io/publication/tramas/","section":"publication","summary":"2019 - *(with Canaval, G., Valencia, C., Mu√±oz, E., Tovar, R., Trivi√±o, Z.
