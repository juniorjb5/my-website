On this occasion, we had the opportunity to participate in the advances in statistical workshop developed by the Colombian Statistics Society (SCE - Sociedad Colombiana de Estad√≠stica), Inter American Statistical Institute, and National University of Colombia (UNAL - Universidad Nacional de Colombia).\n  Download the slides.\nAbstract This paper proposes to study the external macroeconomic determinants on financial markets. Under the hypothesis of efficient markets, prices reflect all available information, so this paper will focus on the MSCI Colombia index, which measures the high and mid-capitalization segments of the stock market. The literature focuses on studying the macroeconomic effects at the variable level on the income market. However, from the statistical and econometric point of view, the possible omission of different effects associated with macroeconomic variables that are not considered in the different models in the literature is proposed, this shows a possible increase in the error of the estimates, which can generate biased estimates of macroeconomic movements on returns in the stock market. This is why a detailed analysis of the impact of the global set of macroeconomic variables on market capitalization is necessary.\nIn this work, the generation of latent macroeconomic factors is proposed from a large set of variables, subsequently the macroeconomic factors are identified and interpreted to determine the effects in the terms of trade on the MSCI Colombia index. An extensive database is used, made up of 106 macroeconomic variables corresponding to the period 2001-2020, and the effect of macroeconomic shocks is estimated using a DLNM model.\nOur results show there are mainly three statistical factors that underlie the macroeconomic dynamics in Colombia. The results suggest that the first latent factor is associated with economic activity. The second factor is related to the external sector (imports, exports and exchange rate), and the third factor to the labor force and retail. We conclude that the effects are asymmetric on the rental market in addition to achieving stabilization of the shock after the third period. In addition, we identify that the market is more sensitive to economic activity compared to other macroeconomic factors.\nüëã All Comments are welcome.\nüì© orlando.joaqui@correounivalle.edu.co\nüì© osorio.brayan@correounivalle.edu.co\nüì© carolina.ramirez.patino@correounivalle.edu.co\n","date":1637798400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1637798400,"objectID":"23d723f3a836e87261acad15e471039f","permalink":"www.joaquibarandica.io/project/sce/","publishdate":"2021-11-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.joaquibarandica.io/project/sce/","section":"project","summary":"Nov. 25 - 26 / 2021","tags":["Colombian Stock Exchange","Finance","DLNM","Macroeconomics"],"title":"Workshop Advances in Statistical Methods","type":"project"},{"authors":["Orlando Joaqui Barandica"],"categories":["R","Xaringan","ggplot2","plotly","highcharter","dplyr"],"content":"\r\r\rThese slides will cover a mix of styles for #DataViz.

The Observatory for business sustainability, Kair√≥s, created in 2017, is a space for observation and analysis of business practices in business sustainability. The main objective is to contribute to the generation of knowledge on business responsibility and sustainability through the analysis of the practices and strategies of Colombian companies with a multidisciplinary approach.\nIn this application, the objective is to evaluate the disclosure index on topics such as employment, environment, community, consumers and products, human rights and the economy.\nWe analyze the sustainability reports of companies through text mining. This allows different measurements to be calculated by company, sector and country.\nVisit  üëâ Barometer App üìö Kair√≥s Observatory üèõÔ∏è Universidad ICESI  ","date":1621814400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621814400,"objectID":"e567b69a82ae9f52bc2d859914f9701e","permalink":"www.joaquibarandica.io/post/barometro/","publishdate":"2021-05-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.joaquibarandica.io/post/barometro/","section":"post","summary":"Welcome, üëã Together with the observatory for business sustainability, Kair√≥s of the ICESI University, an application was made that allowed to know the corporate social responsibility of companies in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.","tags":["Academic","Corporate Social Responsibility","Shiny","Text Mining"],"title":"Corporate Social Responsibility Barometer, an app of text mining.","type":"post"},{"authors":["Orlando Joaqui Barandica"],"categories":["Transport","Multinomial regression","Economy"],"content":"Visit  üëâ Full Publication  ","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575158400,"objectID":"5bdeef61dfd0d5a68b77618fed7e2a4b","permalink":"www.joaquibarandica.io/publication/libreempresa/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.joaquibarandica.io/publication/libreempresa/","section":"publication","summary":"2019 - *(with Rodriguez-Barco, D.).* '**Libre Empresa, 16 (2), 65-79**'","tags":["Multinomial regression","Logit","Probit","Transport"],"title":"Choosing the type of transport in the working class in Colombia: An analysis by region","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Orlando Joaqui Barandica"],"categories":null,"content":"Visit  üëâ Full Publication  ","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575158400,"objectID":"345b54030a26ea6162a297a04476f8db","permalink":"www.joaquibarandica.io/publication/tramas/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.joaquibarandica.io/publication/tramas/","section":"publication","summary":"2019 - *(with Canaval, G., Valencia, C., Mu√±oz, E., Tovar, R., Trivi√±o, Z.
